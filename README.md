# GalaxyWarsM65
I am happy to own a MEGA65 Devkit. Having a Devkit without developing something is not that good.
Without knowing anything about assembler I have started to read bits and bytes from serveral ressources. Since my chiildhood it was a dream to make a game....
Now after about 35 years it's time to start with the next step to fullfil my dream.

## Development environment
Actually I am coding on a windows notebook with Visual Studio Code and KickAssembler. 

### compile.bat 
Use following command to compile and open it directly in xemu 

´compile.bat main.prg xemu´

Use following command to compile and send it directly to Mega65 

´compile.bat main.prg m65´
