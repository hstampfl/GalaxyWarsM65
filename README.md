# GalaxyWarsM65
I am happy to own a MEGA65 Devkit. Having a Devkit without developing something is not that good.
Without knowing anything about assembler I have started to read bits and bytes from serveral ressources. Since my chiildhood it was a dream to make a game....
Now after about 35 years it's time to start with the next step to fullfil my dream.
